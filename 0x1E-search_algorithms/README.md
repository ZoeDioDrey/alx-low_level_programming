0x1E C - Search Algorithms ‚úèÔ∏è
C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. This projects covers the concepts of searching algoritms as well as the big o notation for the respective algorithms

At the end of this project, Iwas able to solve these questions:

What is a search algorithm
What is a linear search
What is a binary search
What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs
